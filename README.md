# NPPE3_DLP (Denoising and 4x Super-Resolution of Low-Light Images)
Deep Learning Practice - Non-Proctored Programming Exam 3

---

## Overview
The goal of this competition is to develop robust deep learning models capable of denoising and enhancing the resolution of low-light images. Participants will work with a dataset of low-light images affected by noise and poor visibility, aiming to produce high-quality outputs that are both visually appealing and rich in detail. Specifically, the task is to denoise the images and perform 4x super-resolution, significantly improving their clarity and resolution

## Dataset
The dataset will consist of three key components:

Training Set: Contains low-resolution, noisy images along with their corresponding high-resolution, clean ground truth images.

Evaluation Set: Similar to the training set, it includes low-resolution, noisy images and their corresponding high-resolution, clean images, allowing participants to validate the performance of their models during development.

Test Set: Comprises only low-resolution, noisy images without any corresponding high-resolution, clean images. The performance of the models will be evaluated on this set.

## Evaluation
Submissions will be assessed based on Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) score.
